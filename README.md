# Fetch-Result-using-Python  
This project uses python 3 to display the results of UIET students of batch 2014.

# GUI
I have made use of tkinter to make a graphic user interface.
Now the user can enter the starting  and ending roll number and click on search button to view the results of all roll numbers 
along with their names in another window. The procedure of getting response by sending post request runs in the background and 
it is only after all the results are fetched, that the results appear on the screen.

# Running the program
Run https://github.com/pareksha/Fetch-Result-using-Python/blob/master/tkinter_result.py on python 3.

# Initial rough code
https://github.com/pareksha/Fetch-Result-using-Python/blob/master/result_using_python.py represents my initial base code which 
stores the 6th semester results of all the students of UIET into csv format of  
https://github.com/pareksha/Fetch-Result-using-Python/blob/master/result.csv

# Check working
You can enter roll numbers such as ue144001 to ue144015 to check the working of the code.
